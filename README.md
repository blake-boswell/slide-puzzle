# Slide Puzzle

This is a slide puzzle game that generates NxN puzzles for you to solve. You can replace the generic puzzle pieces with any picture you'd like! If you can't solve the puzzle, you can watch the puzzle solver do its magic and solve it for you!

## Purpose

Just a fun side project I thought of after watching Survivor.

## Getting Started

```sh
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Tests

At this point, I have only added tests that I found were necessary to ensure that the solver was working. I will add more as I see necessary.

To run the tests:

```sh
npm install
npm run test
```
